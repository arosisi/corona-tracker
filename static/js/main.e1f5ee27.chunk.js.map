Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal\r\n                congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms\r\n                are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become\r\n                infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.\r\n                Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing\r\n                special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets\r\n                COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty\r\n                breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical\r\n                problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes,\r\n                are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever,\r\n                cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.\r\n              </Card.Body>\r\n            </Accordion.Collapse>\r\n          </Card>\r\n\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <Card.Header>\r\n              <CustomToggle eventKey='3'>\r\n                How does COVID-19 spread?\r\n              </CustomToggle>\r\n            </Card.Header>\r\n            <Accordion.Collapse eventKey='3'>\r\n              <Card.Body>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The\r\n                  disease can spread from person to person through small\r\n                  droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person\r\n                  with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on\r\n                  objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then\r\n                  catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then\r\n                  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch\r\n                  COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with\r\n                  COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is\r\n                  important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a\r\n                  person who is sick.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <div>\r\n                  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is\r\n                  spread and will continue to share updated findings.\r\n                </div>\r\n                <hr />\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <strong>\r\n                    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through\r\n                    the air?\r\n                  </strong>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <div>\r\n                  Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is\r\n                  mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets\r\n                  rather than through the air.

The risk of\r\n                  catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very\r\n                  low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild\r\n                  symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the\r\n                  disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from\r\n                  someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not\r\n                  feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of\r\n                  transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated\r\n                  findings.\r\n                </div>\r\n                <hr />\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <strong>\r\n                    Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the\r\n                    disease?\r\n                  </strong>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <div>\r\n                  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected\r\n                  person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest\r\n                  the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread\r\n                  through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak.
